# Web Layout with CSS

This project demonstrates a responsive web layout using CSS. It includes a top section with a full-screen background image, an overlay, and a bottom section with multiple content blocks arranged in a flexbox layout. The layout is simple and easy to modify for various use cases.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The layout is built to adapt to different screen sizes using percentage-based widths and flexbox.
- **Full-Screen Background**: The header section contains a full-screen background image with an overlay.
- **Multiple Content Sections**: The bottom section is split into several blocks (with images and text), creating a clean layout for displaying content.
